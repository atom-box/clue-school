## Stack

This is a Symfony 5 project.  

## URL

This is deployed at http://clue.school

## Two apps

### App 1 is a multi-task timer

This is an improved pomodoro timer.  It generates a serial pomodoro that can be easily configured with a .json file.  This part is about 30% built. 

### App 2 is how to take Cornell Notes in a browser

This is a studying app.  You start by pasting in a reading passage you want to deeply understand. The app forces you to encounter it three times, with significant processing on your part each time.  It is flexible: it works well with school texts but you can also use it to remember the journal and newspaper articles you read.

What's a good way to take Cornell Notes? This! ZumTum Cornell Notes was my previous app to do this.

This is only half built.

I thought the rest of the site would be written during October but October turned into a full on job search month. The partially built site can be viewed at [https://clue.school](https://clue.school)
